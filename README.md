### NOTE
- The project is setup as a monolith since its simpler than having client-server model with the time allocated.
- The shortened urls do not resolve to the original urls yet. Added as a TO DO
- Both server and client are served from the same host and port
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### TO DO
- Serve shortened urls that actually resolve to the orginal urls
