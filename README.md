## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

- Command installs required dependancies

### `yarn start`

- Due to nature of challenge, the project is setup as a monolith.\
   This command builds first then runs the build. Both server and client are served from the same host and port\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
